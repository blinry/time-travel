Trying to build an OpenGL program with 15-year-old old libraries! :D

To build, run `nix-build`.

I get this error:

```
X Error of failed request:  BadValue (integer parameter out of range for operation)
  Major opcode of failed request:  152 (GLX)
  Minor opcode of failed request:  3 (X_GLXCreateContext)
  Value in failed request:  0x0
  Serial number of failed request:  17
  Current serial number in output stream:  18
```
